# Unity-Live-Input-FFT-Analysis
> The goal of this script is to handle live audio input analysis as most efficiently as possible within Unity. 

The inspiration and most of the base code hails from the Unity answers forum post [Real time Microphone (line input) FFT analysis](http://answers.unity3d.com/answers/394158/post.html).
